          >After the success of Master in early 2021, it was reported that
          Lokesh Kanagaraj visited Vijay at his residence and narrated a script
          which impressed him. The project was supposed to be the actor's 66th
          film as a leading actor; however, that position instead went to Varisu
          (2023). Reports of a potential collaboration between Lokesh and Vijay
          continued through February 2022. The following March, Lokesh confirmed
          there were discussions for him to direct Vijay's 67th film. That May,
          he confirmed the project, tentatively titled Thalapathy 67. The
          project was funded by S. S. Lalit Kumar's Seven Screen Studio, which
          had distributed and co-produced Master, while Vijay's manager Jagadish
          serves as a co-producer. The company made a public announcement on 30
          January 2023, confirming the project, and the film's official title
          Leo was revealed on 3 February 2023. The film is being made on a
          budget of ₹250–300 crore, and Vijay was reported to receive ₹120 crore
          (US$15 million) as remuneration. However, he reportedly decided to
          take the revenue sharing model, to benefit the film's production; as
          per the basis, he would receive ₹50 crore (US$6.3 million) as an
          advance, and a chunk of the profits would be received as the actor's
          remuneration. Vijay was not in favour of making Leo a pan-Indian film
          as he wanted to focus on satisfying the Tamil audience. The actor,
          however, changed his mind after Lalit and Jagadish convinced him. Some
          changes were also made to the original story to help the film cater to
          a wider audience.</p1
