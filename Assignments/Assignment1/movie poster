      <p class="movie-Review">
        Go and watch this in theater. Mohan Raja made Tamil movies one step
        higher. All the characters have done their best. Jayam Ravi catches all
        the people's attention in each and every second of the movie.
        Nayanthara's best movie I can say. She did a wonderful acting. Each and
        every second of the movie went thrilling and I sat on the edge of the
        seat while watching. Villain was amazing. BOSS OF THE OTHER VILLAINS IN
        TAMIL CINEMA. Only few comedies but nice one. Don't miss it.You can
        watch this movie more than 10 times. It is also the best police based
        movie. There are so many amazing twists in the movie. Best movie of the
        decade.
